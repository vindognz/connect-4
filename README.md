# connect-4

This will eventually become a connect-4 game written in Python with an AI opponent you can play.

I will make and train the AI myself.

I might make a GUI in Pygame, depends if i cbs

todo list:
~~player vs player on the same device~~, player vs player lan, and player vs computer

pvp lan todo:
    (It's in maintenance rn cuz of 1,000,000 serious vulns)
    remember the last ip you played against. remember ip input with a name?
    stop multiple ppl joining one game (or add spectators)
    make it so when ppl leave, the game ends instead of hanging or crashing.

player vs computer todo:
    sometimes it prioritizes vertical 3-in-a-rows instead of a win. (balance threat and winning)
